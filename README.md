# TRIANGLES

This is a fun project I made that simply draws triangle objects on the screen of any size, composed of any symbol or group of symbols.

## USAGE

[code] python triangles.py n symbol [/code]

where [code]n[/code] is the size of the triangle
and [code]symbol[/code] is a string of symbols or symbol that you wish the triangle to be composed of.
