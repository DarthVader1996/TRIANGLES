# TRIANGLES

This is a fun project I made that simply draws triangle objects on the screen of any size, composed of any symbol or group of symbols.

## USAGE

`bash` python triangles.py n symbol `bash`

where `bash`n `bash` is the size of the triangle
and `bash`symbol`bash`is a string of symbols or symbol that you wish the triangle to be composed of.
